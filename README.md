I had to create a simple feedback form using an API with the functionality to add entries to the API, delete entries, modify entries and get the entries in the API.
I had to do it using React.
I used 2 components - Form.js and FeedbackResults.js. 
I used useState hook to store my variables.
I used axios and fetch to send requests to the API. I used GET, POST, DELETE and PUT requests.
I used conditional rendering to display components based on their state.
